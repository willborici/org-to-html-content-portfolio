# Generate a content portolio HTML page out of an org file
Given an intentionally structured content portfolio org-mode file, export it to an HTML page.

A Typical master org file of all published content with canonical or external URIs, this python script uses BeautifulSoup and pandas to generate a chronologically-sorted HTML table that can serve as content portfolio.

As an example, see the links.org file (https://github.com/willborici/org-to-html-content-portfolio/blob/main/links.org?plain=1) for a typical heading-based structure with properties and text below each heading.

You can customize the python script to suit your org file structures.
