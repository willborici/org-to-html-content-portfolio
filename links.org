# This is my master list of links where I've published any content.
# This will not be exported to HTML, but will be used for link transclusion
#   in other files in my website, where needed.
# To transclude a link using the org-transclusion package, the code is:
#     #+transclude: [[[[ id:<ID value> ]]]]
#     where <ID value> is a property under each link heading
# NB: since the id must be unique, precede it with a links_ string!
# Finally, run the M-x org-transclusion-add or add-all command to view the transcluded text
# then, i can delete any text i don't want in the transcluded content without
# affecting this master content here.
